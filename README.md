symfony-blog
============

A Symfony project created on June 19, 2017, 3:08 pm.
# symfony-blog

Completed post submission, blog listing, and validation.

Unfortunately did not know I'd need phpunit on my laptop and had a surprising amount of trouble installing it, so I wasn't able to test my test, haha. I also didn't notice the instructions asking for a unit test, so I wrote a functional test instead.
